# Urban-Mobility-Simulator-in-Mexico-
• Designed an AI system that allows traffic lights to coordinate their timing, thereby reducing congestion at an intersection. • Created the computer graphics in Unity, using prefabs to simulate a real-life intersection. • Implemented Python and the module Mesa for modeling the Agents to predict the projections that the cars obtain given this complex phenomenon. • Employed Python and Flask to obtain the coordinates and deploy the information in IBM Cloud. • Connected Unity with IBM Cloud using C# to process the information and run the simulation in a 3D environment.
