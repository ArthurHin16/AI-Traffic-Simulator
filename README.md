# AI Traffic Simulator in Mexico

This project focuses on developing an AI-based traffic simulator aimed at optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion at intersections in Mexico. Below are the key highlights of the project:

## Features:

- **AI Traffic Management System**: Designed and implemented an AI system that enables traffic lights to coordinate their timing, thereby improving traffic flow and reducing congestion at intersections.

- **Unity Graphics**: Utilized Unity to create computer graphics, leveraging prefabs to simulate real-life intersections. The visually immersive environment enhances the simulation experience.

- **Agent-Based Modeling with Python**: Implemented Python, along with the Mesa module, to model agents and predict car projections within the complex traffic environment. This approach provides insights into traffic behavior and helps in optimizing traffic management strategies.

- **Integration with IBM Cloud**: Utilized Python and Flask to collect coordinates and deploy information to IBM Cloud. This integration enables efficient data management and analysis for traffic simulation.

- **Unity-IBM Cloud Connectivity**: Connected Unity with IBM Cloud using C#, enabling the processing of information and simulation execution within a 3D environment. This seamless integration facilitates real-time analysis and visualization of traffic scenarios.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements file.
3. Follow the setup instructions provided in the project documentation.
4. Run the simulation script to initiate the AI traffic simulator.
5. Access the simulation results and visualizations through the provided interfaces.
